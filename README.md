# publicTweeter
Part II of my final assignment in Computing for Engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology

Unlike all previous homework assignments, this project was left very open-ended, with the only requirement being
that I utilize APIs to do something with data from the web (see Project.pdf for the specific assignment).

**publicTweeter** provides rudimentary analysis of a public figure's recent Tweets and the New York Times's
most recent headline about the user. Uses [twitty](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34837-twitty) to access the Twitter API

## Dependencies
* [twitty](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34837-twitty)
* [New York Times API Access](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
* [Twitter API Access](https://developer.twitter.com/)
